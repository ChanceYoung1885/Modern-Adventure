            <p>
                Welcome to Modern Adventure. To bring excitement and a small thrill to young adults, video games used to be about battles and fantasy, 
                but nowadays anxiety is everywhere and that gives you all the thrill and excitement you could ask for. In todays Modern Adventure, 
                you are an anxiety ridden individual tasked with going to your local convenience store and purchasing snacks and drinks for your friends 
                before your anxiety reaches the boiling point and you cancel your friend hangout AGAIN...
            </p>
            <p>
                To begin, like most of us nowadays, you'll need to ask for help. If you can bring yourself to do it, type help.
